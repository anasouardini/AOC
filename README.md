Advent Of Code challenges are really cool challenge almost like leetcode except that this one is more real world where it makes you focus on writing not only a working solution to a problem but also code that can easily be adjusted as the problem changes.

This is by no means the proper solutions to these quizes. this repository is me trying to do one a day as fast as possible to make it more challenging.
